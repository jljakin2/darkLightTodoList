## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- React (class based to handle state and functional for other components)
- Styled-components used to style components
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at having dark-mode/light-mode feature. I found an efficient way to handle the different themes thanks to styled-components so it was easier than I thought it would be. I also feel a lot more comfortable using functions as props.
